This file is a placeholder. You need to create two icon files:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

Place these files in the public directory. You can use any image editor or online tool to create them.

The app will work without these icons, but they are required for proper PWA installation.
